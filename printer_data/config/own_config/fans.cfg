heater: mcu_temp
#   Assuming you want the fan to run when the MCU temperature rises.
#   If you want it to run whenever the 'extruder' is on, change this to 'extruder'.

heater_temp: 50.0
#   The fan will run at fan_speed when the 'heater' is above this temperature.
#   When the 'heater' drops below this temperature, the fan will stop (or go to off_below speed).

fan_speed: 1.0
#   Sets the fan to full speed (1.0) when the 'heater' is active and above 'heater_temp'.
